# PlantBreeding
AI school project

Good news, everybody! 
The project is not very complex, but, to organise ourselves a little, we should:

- for all the teams:
	- take a look around the arhitecture folder and:
		- complete the arhitecture/research folder with the information you already have
		- complete the Arhitecture/Project plan/Teams composition.txt with your name and github username
		- make a a "planning.jpg" document (do it on paper for now) in Project plan/%team% for at least the next two weeks
			 with the way you plan your future tasks (take a look at Project plan/Prediction/Planning.png)
		- use the UML folder to organise your work on the module if you feel the need to, we will discuss use cases at the laboratory
	
	
- for the Interface team: 
	in Arhitecture/GUI, you can start with a design of the graphic user interface, put it as a task in Arhitecture/Project plan/Interface/planning

Good luck!
